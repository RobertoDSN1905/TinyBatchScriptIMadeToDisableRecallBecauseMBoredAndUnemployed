## About this little batch file of 1 line 

As the repo's name implies... I made this tiny batch script to disable windows recall because 'm bored and unemployed...
since it's gonna re-enable again every windows update and you gotta manually disable it I decided to make a **tiny** batch script.

### how to run it
**NOTE : RECALL IS ONLY IN W11 PRO AND IN THE VERSION 24H2**  
1.- right click on the .bat file (you know which one).  
2.- run as administrator.  
4.- after that it will ask you to restart to apply changes.  
5.- to check if everythings done use the other file.  
3.- all done.  

if something happens lemme know or if it didn't worked lemme know too.

Have a good day/afternoon/night.

with love Roberto. ;^)

P.S. while I was making this I was listening to : " let's face it Pal, You Didn't Need That Eye Surgery " by Don caballero
